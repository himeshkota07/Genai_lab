Browse through the available models, which are categorized by type (e.g., language, image, etc.).\n","2. Select a model that interests you, such as a language model like \"Text-DaVinci-002\" or an image model like \"DALL-E\".\n","3. Click on the model to open its playground interface.\n","\n","**Using the Playground Interface**\n","\n","1.
